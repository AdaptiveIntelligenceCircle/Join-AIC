# License & legal note

AIC is an ecosystem of repos that can have different licenses (Apache-2.0, MIT, GPLv3, etc.). When contributing:

- Pay attention to the license of the repo you contribute to.

- If you want the node to be listed but with a different license, specify it in the node manifest.

I do not force a common license for the entire ecosystem. If you want me to create an English variant or suggest an official license for join-AIC, let me know.
