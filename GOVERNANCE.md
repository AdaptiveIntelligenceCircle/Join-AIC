# Governance (lightweight proposal)

AIC follows a decentralized, non-hierarchical model but needs some mechanisms to operate.

## Principles
- **Opt-in governance:** nodes & contributors choose to participate in decisions.

- **Minimal council:** group of maintainers representing the core repo — term 3–6 months.

- **Signals not mandates:** use signaling (vote, RFC + reactions) to guide actions, not mandatory.

## Major change process
1. Create RFC file: `rfcs/xxxx.md` (describe problem, proposal, migration).

2 weeks public discussion + 1 week feedback.
3. If majority maintainers agree → merge & schedule migration.

## Node trust model
- Each node describes the trust_model (see `JOIN_GUIDE.md` template).
- Interoperable solutions must respect privacy & non-central control.
